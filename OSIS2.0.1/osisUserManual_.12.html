         </h2>
         <p>Note the updated schema and users manual number. One of
      our users already spotted a bug and it has been
      corrected. Make sure the schema and users manual you are
      consulting correspond in the numbering.</p>
         <p><a name="d0e204"></a>As you go through this guide to the OSIS 2.0.1 schema, you are going
              to notice mistakes, omissions and examples you don't find
                 useful. Those were not left as an exercise for the reader.
         </p>
         
         <p><a name="d0e207"></a>The editors discussed having a registry of Bible verses for people
                 who contribute corrections, supply omissions or examples but
                 feared that there might be more corrections, supplied omissions
                 or examples than there are verses in the Bible. Not to mention
                 that some verses are more popular than others.
         </p>
             
         <p><a name="d0e210"></a>So, as an alternative, future versions of the OSIS User's
                 Manual will have a Contributor's section, which will list your
                 name and the number of corrections or supplied omissions/examples
                that you have contributed to the manual. Counting by the editors
                 will be final but generous and credit given for duplicates or
                 suggestions not ultimately used in the form submitted. Please
                 specify if you want your email contact information included as
                 well. Address your comments, corrections, supplied
                 omissions/examples, to <a href="mailto:osis-editors@bibletechnologieswg.org">osis-editors@bibletechnologieswg.org</a>.
         </p>
             
         <p><a name="d0e213"></a>This manual is meant to be a guide for all users of the OSIS
                 schema and your assistance will be appreciate both by the editors
                as well as the community of OSIS users.

                 Welcome to the OSIS (Open Scriptural Information Standard&#8482;)
            User's Manual. OSIS is a set of XML structures that can be used to
            produce Bibles, commentaries, and related texts that can be easily
            interchanged with other users, formatted as HTML, PDF, Postscript or
            any other desired format, and searched on any personal computer. It
            provides a standard way to express such documents, which is important
            because it saves time, money, and effort for:

               authors, who will have less need to adjust their manuscripts for each
               different potential publisher;
               
            </li>
            <li class="body"><a name="d0e233"></a>
               publishers, who will gradually come to experience lower costs by not
               having to manage converting texts presented by authors in so wide a
               variety of formats, and by not having to provide texts in a different
               form to each electronic-book system vendor out there (or pay
               indirectly for those vendors to do the conversions).
               
            </li>
            <li class="body"><a name="d0e236"></a>
               and software vendors, who can avoid writing a lot of code to manage
               different formats, and thus make their programs smaller, faster, and
               more reliable.

            The OSIS development team closely studied previous Bible encoding
            forms, as well as tools for literary encoding in general. By doing
            this we hope we have avoided some weaknesses, and gained from some
            strengths, of each one, and we thank the many people who worked on
            those prior specifications, as well as those who have provided help
            and feedback in developing OSIS itself, and testing it by encoding
            large numbers of Biblical and related texts. A list of participants
            may be found in an Appendix.
         </p>
         
         
         <p><a name="d0e243"></a>Users familiar with the Text Encoding Initiative will find OSIS
            markup quite familiar, because the bulk of the elements we define
            correspond directly to TEI elements, and almost always have the same
            name (though often simplified content). The schema also provides a
            TEIform attribute for such elements, so they can be recognized by
            form-aware processors as equivalent to their TEI counterparts. We
            have attempted to point out any elements below that do not have TEI
            equivalents, for the sake of anyone using both systems.

         <p><a name="d0e246"></a>OSIS is provided as a free resource by the Bible Technologies
            Group&#8482; (or BTG&#8482;), which is a collaborative effort of the
            American Bible Society, the Society of Biblical Literature, the
            Summer Institute of Linguistics, the United Bible Societies, other
            Bible Societies and related groups, and individual volunteers around
            the world. OSIS is designed to meet the needs of diverse user
            communities who read, study, research, translate or distribute
            biblical texts. This introduction gives a brief overview of OSIS

            text.

         <h2><a name="body.1_div.2"></a>2. Getting started
         </h2>
         
              
         <p><a name="d0e257"></a>The first question that is often asked when learning that OSIS
            uses XML (a markup language) is: "I'm not a computer person. Can
            I learn to use OSIS?" If you can type and use even the most
            basic word processor or computer text-editing program, the answer is
            clearly "Yes!" OSIS was designed to be offer the beginning
            user a simple way to do the basic "markup" required for a standard
            biblical text. "Markup" refers to markers placed within the text,
            that indicate where useful units (or "elements") such as verses,
            quotations, cross-references, and other things begin and end.
         </p>
         
         
         <p><a name="d0e260"></a>If you know HTML, you already know most of what you need to know
            to use OSIS; OSIS uses the same pointy-bracket syntax as HTML (or
            XHTML to be completely precise). It merely provides a different set
            of element and attribute names. A few names such as "p" and "div" are
            the same; others are new, such as "verse". The core set of elements
            for OSIS is actually smaller than the set for HTML 3.2. To be sure,
            there are some complex cases that we deal with later, but you can do
            useful work with no more information than is provided in this basic
            manual.
         </p>
         
         
         <p><a name="d0e263"></a>The second question that is most often asked is: &#8216;Do I need an
            XML editor to do OSIS?&#8217; This question often comes up after a
            friend of a friend has recommended some editor, and you then checked
            its price. XML editors vary from free to over $10,000.00 (US), and
            many are difficult to use (though XMetal&#8482; is a notable
            exception, and not very expensive).
         </p>
         
         
         <p><a name="d0e269"></a>
            The basic answer is no, you do not need any special software. You can
            use any text editor you like to create OSIS documents (or any other
            XML documents, for that matter). Many will even color the tags for
            you, because they know how to color HTML tags and the languages are
            similar enough. However, you should have a way to check your documents
            for errors -- if your editor doesn't know enough about XML to warn you
            if you misspell a tag, or forget to end some element that you started,
            you will want to check for errors periodically using an "XML
            validator". Many such program are available for various computers;
            some are available as Web services. (See Appendix, <i>Validating Your
               OSIS Document</i> for pointers and instructions on web based validation
            services.) Both Internet Explorer and Netscape can also validate an
            OSIS file once you have installed the OSIS rules file (called a
            "schema") and an appropriate stylesheet.
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p><a name="d0e275"></a>
            An OSIS-aware text editor will do this checking for you, either on
            demand or continuously. A friendlier OSIS-aware text editor will
            provide help by showing you just which elements are permitted at any
            given place. The friendliest editors also give you the option to see
            and edit a fully-formatted view on demand, rather than staring
            directly at pointy-brackets. The choice between the many tools is a
            personal one, dictated by your working style, level of technical
            sophistication, goals, budget, and other factors.

         <p><a name="d0e284"></a>
            The OSIS team is working even as this manual is being written to
            adapt free authoring tools that will hide most if not all of the
            markup from the casual user of OSIS. In the meantime, the best way to
            learn OSIS is to use a simple text editor, such as WordPad or Kedit
            on Windows, BBEdit or Alpha on MacOS, or vi or emacs on Linux. You
            can even use a word processor, though any formatting that you do in
            it won't matter (you would simply save the file as "text only").
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p><a name="d0e287"></a>The examples in this manual have been kept deliberately short and
            can be downloaded as a package from the OSIS website. After you have
            gained some basic skill using OSIS, you may want try out more
            sophisticated editors.
         </p>
         
         
         
         <p><a name="d0e290"></a>
            Editing is much easier with an editing program that is aware of XML
            rules in general, and OSIS in particular. For example, rather than
            seeing literal tags with pointy-brackets, you can have a choice of
            seeing that, or structural views of your document (say, as a tree or
            expandable outline), or fully-formatted views to facilitate print
            layout.
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p><a name="d0e293"></a>
            Many products are available that can help you edit XML documents. One
            style shows the literal XML source file, but colors tags, attributes,
            and other things to make them stand out. Most such programs also read
            an XML schema and ensure that you only insert elements and attributes
            are permitted by the OSIS schema (schemas, such as the OSIS one,
            declare what elements and attributes are permitted where in documents
            of a particular kind). One free and helpful tool of this kinds is
            jEdit, which runs on most platforms. It can be set up to know about
            many kinds of files, including XML files, and OSIS in particular.
            
         </p>
         
         
         
         <p><a name="d0e296"></a>
            With such an editor, you can see or print a basic a formatted view by
            using most any Web browser. Later in this manual are instructions for
            setting up an OSIS file with a style sheet (generally in CSS) so that
            typical browsers can deal with it.
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p><a name="d0e299"></a>
            There are also more word-processor-like XML editors, which primarily
            show a formatted view defined by some style sheet. These are mainly
            commercial. XML Spy is one such tool (see http://www.xmlspy.com/);
            XMetal (see
            http://www.corel.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=Corel/Products/productInfo&amp;id=1042152754863)
            is another.

         <p><a name="d0e302"></a>
            For high-end layout and typesetting from XML source files, usually a
            stylesheet language called XSL-FO is used. Two of the more popular
            commercial XSL-FO solutions are 3b2 (see http://www.3b2.com/), and
            Antenna House (see http://www.antennahouse.com/). Non-XML-based
            composition systems such as Quark&#8482; and TeX generally have ways
            to import XML, but using them for XML composition requires
            substantial expertise and effort.

         <p><a name="d0e310"></a>Like HTML documents, an OSIS document starts with a header,
            and then goes on to the actual text content. The header identifies
            the file as being XML, and as using the OSIS schema. It also

     During the third year of his rule, Xerxes gave a big dinner for all

     were also invited, and even the commanders of the Persian and Median 
     armies came.

                The first line above identifies the document as being XML; this

            The second through third lines are a very long start-tag for the
            outermost OSIS element, which is called "osis." All elements in an
                 OSIS document must be declared within the OSIS namespace. There
                 are two ways to achieve this and other than remembering to pick
                 one of the two following methods, that is all you need remember
                 about it to start encoding texts using OSIS 2.0.

            Note with the second method, the last closing element must be:

         <p><a name="d0e346"></a>
            At this point, the OSIS document has begun. This sample is a single
                 document rather than a collection of documents, so the next element
            opened is <b>osisText</b>:
            
         </p>
         
         <pre class="eg">

</pre>
         
         
         <p><a name="d0e355"></a>Every <b>osisText</b> needs to supply an <b>osisIDWork</b> attribute and value. The value will
                  generally be the short name of what is being encoded, in this
                  case the Contemporary English Version, or CEV. The short name is
                  defined in the <b>work</b> declaration for the
                  work, described later. The <b>work</b> element
                  that identifies the work being encoded should be the first <b>work</b> element, if the text has more than
                  one. This sets things up for some of the later elements nested
                  within the <b>osisText</b> element. One such
                  element is <b>work</b>. It requires an <b>osisWork</b> attribute. That attribute's value has
                  to be the same as the value found on the <b>osisIDWork</b> attribute of <b>osisText</b> (see line 7 of the sample). Other
                  elements use/require an <b>osisID</b> attribute
                  which refer back to the <b>osisIDWork</b>
                  attribute of <b>osisText</b> (see lines 19 and 21
                  of the sample).

         <p><a name="d0e397"></a>
            Every <b>osisText</b> also needs to specify what reference or versification
            scheme any osisRefs within it refer to. This may or may not be the
            same work. Depending on how finely you distinguish things, there are
            several major versification traditions, and countless fine-grained
            variations. For the present, we identify and reserve names for these
            major traditional reference systems:

            OSIS is developing a schema for declaring versification systems
            formally, and for declaring some systems in terms of others. This
            will enable programs to map between systems. However, at this time we
            merely reserve the names above for some systems we know to be
            substantially different and important.

      <div class="teidiv">
         <h2><a name="body.1_div.6"></a>6. Canonical vs. non-canonical parts of a work
         </h2>
         
         
         <p><a name="d0e468"></a>
            The element <b>osisText</b> has one other important attribute that is not shown above.
            It is called "canonical", and always has a value of "true" or
            "false". When true, it asserts that the content is a part of the text
            being encoded. For example, the "text" of the Bible includes the content
            of books, chapters, and verses but does not include notes,
            section-headings added by editors or translators, etc.
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p><a name="d0e474"></a>
            The <b>canonical</b> attribute is available on all elements. Its value
            inherits in the same manner as xml:lang. Because of this inheritance,
            encoders will seldom need to make this attribute explicit. In <b>osisText</b> this attribute is set to a default
                 value of "true", while header, note, and
            reference that setting is overidden by setting the value of that
                 attribute to be "false."
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p><a name="d0e483"></a>
            In books other than the Bible, a similar distinction holds: the text
            proper of Herodotus' Histories must be contained in elements with
            canonical="true", while notes, header data, and the like must not.
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p><a name="d0e486"></a>
            The meaning of this attribute is limited. It must not be used to
            encode interpretive or theological judgements about canonicity. For
            example, encoders who include the apocryphal books of the Bible, or
            the alternate longer ending to the Gospel of Mark, must mark them as
            canonical (whether by default or explicitly). This is simply because
            they are part of the text being encoded. Users of a text are never
            justified in drawing conclusions about a translator's, editor's, or
            encoder's position on questions of inspiration or other theological
            questions based on how they set the <b>canonical</b>
            attribute, because the attribute does not mean that.
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p><a name="d0e492"></a>
            In most cases use of the <b>canonical</b> attribute is
            straightforward, and we expect that the default values will almost
            always produce the intended result. However, there will arise truly
            difficult cases: for example, one may be encoding an ancient text
            with annotations of its own. In that case those notes would be
            canonical, while any added by the current editor would not be. In
            such cases, the practice chosen and its rationale should be described
            in the work's documentation.

         <p><a name="d0e503"></a>
            The first element within every <b>osisText</b> must be a
            <b>header</b>. The <b>header</b> declares
            various works (including the work being encoded and any that are
            being referenced), and provides a place to keep a revision history of
            the text.

            <p><a name="d0e519"></a>
               To record changes or edits to the text, authors and editors are
               encouraged to insert a <b>change</b> element every time
               significant editing is done. Each <b>change</b> element
               should contain a <b>date</b> element which says when
               those edits were completed, in the form
               
            </p>

               Note that all fields must have exactly the number of digits shown
               (4-digit year, 2-digit month, etc.). It is permissible to omit the
               time and the preceding "T", thus giving just a date. For example,
               December 25th of 1999 CE would be:
            </p>
            
            <pre class="eg">
    1999-12-25
</pre>
            
            <p><a name="d0e540"></a>A <b>date</b> element in the revision description is
               followed by any number of <b>p</b> (paragraph) elements,
               in which the changes made are summarized. The person responsible for
               making the changes should also be identified, using the <b>resp</b> attribute on the <b>change</b>
               element.
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p><a name="d0e555"></a>
               Recommended practice is that more recent <b>change</b>
               elements appear earlier in the document. That is, entries should
               occur in reverse chronological order. For example:

                   A <b>work</b> element is a declaration. It provides
               information comparable to that found on the title page of a printed
               work, using the fields defined by the Dublin Core Initiative (see
               http://dublincore.org/).

                     attribute that matches the <b>osisIDRef</b> in the
                     <b>osisText</b> element identifies the work in which it occurs -- much
               like the title page in a printed work. For example:
            </p>
            
            <pre class="eg">

	&lt;osisText osisIDWork="CEV" osisRefWork="Bible" lang="en"&gt;

            <p><a name="d0e599"></a>Note that the match between <b>osisIDWork="CEV"</b>
                     in <b>osisText</b> and <b>osisWork="CEV"</b> in the <b>work</b>
                     element links this <b>osisText</b> to this
                     particular <b>work</b> element.
            </p>
            
                 
            <p><a name="d0e620"></a>Subsequent <b>work</b> elements identify other
               works -- much like a citation in a footnote or bibliography in a
               printed work. Each assigns a <i>local name</i> to each
               one, using the <b>osisWork</b> attribute. Works so
               declared can then be referred to from <b>osisID</b>s or
               <b>osisRef</b>s throughout the text. For Bibles, this
               should generally be the accepted acronym or abbreviated form of the
               translation's name (some standard version abbreviations are listed in

            <p><a name="d0e646"></a>Each <b>work</b> element describes a single
               publication using several pieces of information, primarily <b>title</b>,
               <b>creator</b>, <b>date</b>, <b>publisher</b>, <b>identifier</b> and <b>language</b>. All of the standard
               "Dublin Core" fields may be used, plus a few OSIS-specific additions
               (further information on the Dublin Core system may be found at
               http://www.dublincore.org). All of the Dublin core fields may be
               repeated as necessary, but must be encoded in the order shown
               here. For example:

                  to be recorded, use multiple publisher elements and distinguish them

                  in this attribute is not constrained but it is suggested that values
                  that tie a publisher to a particular edition, such as &lt;publisher

                  the <b>type</b> attribute (for example, <b>&lt;type type="DCMI"&gt;</b>). To describe the physical or
                  digital manifestation of the resource, use the <b>format</b> element instead.

            <p><a name="d0e1269"></a>If no perfect match can be found, applications may, indeed should,
               attempt to fall back to the closest available publication. OSIS does
               not define a required method of fallback, or define what "closest"
               must mean in all contexts. However, one possible approach is to
               successively ignore particular elements in this order:
            </p>
            
            
            <ul>
               <li class="body"><a name="d0e1274"></a>Identifier: because identifiers are often
                  ambiguous. For example, hardcover and softcover editions of a book
                  typically have different ISBNs, and occasionally publishers re-use an
                  old ISBN for a completely different book.
               </li>
               <li class="body"><a name="d0e1279"></a>Date: because a different imprint or edition of
                  the same conceptual work is typically adequate. Precisely targeted
                  links, however, may not refer to the exact location desired.
                  Applications may wish to ignore all dates except for the original
                  publication date.
               </li>
               <li class="body"><a name="d0e1284"></a>Publisher: because several publishers may
                  publish a given work (particularly older works), publishers may change
                  name, etc.
               </li>
               <li class="body"><a name="d0e1289"></a>Language: Accepting a publication that
                  does not match in language is a substantial concession. However, some
                  variations of language are greater than others. For example, some
                  modern Bible translations are available in separate American and
                  British English versions, and substituting one for the other is not
                  unreasonable. This is particularly true because translations
                  generally use translated titles as well, and so if the language is
                  not closely related, the title will probably not match either.
                  Applications may wish to encode some knowledge of language and
                  dialect similarities to implement more sophisticated
                  fallback.
               </li>
               <li class="body"><a name="d0e1294"></a>Creator: because some authors have
                  multiple forms of name: St. Augustine vs. Augustine of Hippo vs.
                  Augustine. The Bible Technology Group intends to develop an
                  authority list of normative name-forms for relevant authors, and once
                  such a list is available, using it will help to avoid such problems.
                  As with other elements, more sophisticated applications may wish to
                  attempt some kind of approximate matching in order to achieve better
                  fallback.
               </li>
               <li class="body"><a name="d0e1299"></a>Title: the final item to discard is
                  probably title. If a work's title differs, it is probably a different
                  work, or at least a translation into a non-close language. On the
                  other hand, some titles have been used by multiple authors, and so a

         <p><a name="d0e1367"></a>In order to make the encoding of title pages as found in standard
            works easier, OSIS 2.0 introduced the <b>titlePage</b>

            <b>title</b>, <b>contributor</b>, <b>creator</b>, <b>subject</b>, <b>date</b>, <b>description</b>, <b>publisher</b>, <b>type</b>, <b>format</b>, <b>identifier</b>, <b>source</b>, <b>language</b>, <b>relation</b>, <b>coverage</b>, which are
            explained in the material on the <b>header</b>
            section. Three additional elements are allowed, which are <b>figure</b>, <b>milestone</b>, and, <b>p</b>. Due to the complexity of title pages, all of these
            elements may occur in any order inside the <b>titlePage</b> element.

         <p><a name="d0e1430"></a>The <b>titlePage</b> element can occur within the <b>osis</b>, <b>osisText</b>, and, <b>osisCorpus</b> elements.

            more importantly, what is not useful to have encoded in a work.

            While book, chapter, and verse numbers are a familiar and useful way
            of referring to locations in the Bible, they often conflict with the
            boundaries of parables, stories, genealogies, paragraphs, quotations,
            and other important units of understanding. Even to print a
            well-formatted Bible edition, and much more to support high-end
            search, annotation, and other capabilities, these meaningful units
            must also commonly be marked.
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p><a name="d0e1461"></a>
            It is possible to encode a Bible using only book, chapter, and verse
            markup. However, most encoders also want to also represent sections,
            paragraphs, quotations, and so on. Higher-level structures are tagged
            as <b>div</b>, for "division", with a <b>type</b> attribute to specify the particular significance.
            <b>div</b> elements can occur within other <b>div</b> elements to any number of levels. The first and
            outermost <b>div</b> should occur immediately after the
            end of the header. For example,
            
         </p>
         
         <pre class="eg">

&lt;div type="book" osisID="Gen"&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;Genesis&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;chapter osisID="Gen.1"&gt;
  	  &lt;head&gt;1&lt;/head&gt;
  	  &lt;verse osisID="Gen.1.1"&gt;In the beginning,...&lt;/verse&gt;
  	  &lt;verse osisID="Gen.1.2"&gt;The earth was formless and void...&lt;/verse&gt;
  	  ...

  </pre>
         
         <p><a name="d0e1482"></a>
            The <b>div</b> element is used for many top-level
            components, and so makes heavy use of the <b>type</b>
            attribute. The pre-defined types include the most common major
            divisions found in present-day Bibles and related works:

            The main body of a Bible will typically consist of <b>div</b> elements of <b>type="bookGroup"</b>
            (such as each Testament, the Apocrypha, and perhaps smaller groups
            such as the Pentateuch, the Minor Prophets, etc), plus any front and
            back matter divisions (the selection of which varies greatly between
            editions).
         </p>
         
         
         <p><a name="d0e1602"></a>With each <b>bookGroup div</b>, there will typically
            be <b>book div</b>s corresponding to each included
            Canonical or deutero-canonical book. Some books are divided into
            majorSections (such as the sub-books in Psalms), sections (typically
            topical divisions with headings), subSections (occasional minor
            divisions within sections). A specific <b>chapter</b>
            element is provided and encouraged, though <b>div
               type="chapter"</b> is also permissible. 
         </p>
         
         
         <p><a name="d0e1617"></a>Below this point typical texts switch from successive levels of
            <b>div</b> elements, to more specific markup such as
            paragraphs, lists, quotations, inscriptions, and the like. Also at
            this level, the markup begins commonly to interact with verse markup.
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p><a name="d0e1623"></a>Use of the types defined for <b>div</b> is mandatory
            when a provided type is applicable. For example, a colophon must be
            marked up as <b>&lt;div type='colophon'&gt;</b>.
            If types not provided are needed, they may be added but must begin
            with "x-", to distinguish them from OSIS-standard values.
         </p>
         
         
         <p><a name="d0e1632"></a>
            Such markup forms the primary backbone of an OSIS document. Chapter
            and verse elements are important (particularly for retrieval), but
            considered to be an overlay onto the more linguistic or thematic
            structure. Therefore, so long as verses or chapters do not cross the
            boundaries of other elements, they may be expressed in the normal
            fashion (NASB):
            
         </p>

&lt;verse osisID="Mark.10.1"&gt;Jesus then left that place and went into
the region of Judea and across the Jordan. Again crowds of people
came to him, and as was his custom, he taught them.
&lt;/verse&gt;
&lt;verse osisID="Mark.10.2"&gt;Some Pharisees came and tested him by
asking, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?"
&lt;/verse&gt;
&lt;verse osisID="Mark.10.3"&gt;"What did Moses command you?" he replied.
&lt;/verse&gt;
&lt;verse osisID="Mark.10.4"&gt;They said, "Moses permitted a man to write
a certificate of divorce and send her away."
&lt;/verse&gt;
&lt;verse osisID="Mark.10.5"&gt;"It was because your hearts were hard that
Moses wrote you this law," Jesus replied. &lt;/verse&gt;
&lt;verse osisID="Mark.10.6"&gt;"But at the beginning of creation God 'made
them male and female.' &lt;/verse&gt;
&lt;verse osisID="Mark.10.7"&gt;'For this reason a man will leave his
father and mother and be united to his wife,&lt;/verse&gt;
&lt;verse osisID="Mark.10.8"&gt;and the two will become one flesh.' So they
are no longer two, but one. &lt;/verse&gt;
&lt;verse osisID="Mark.10.9"&gt;Therefore what God has joined together, let
man not separate."&lt;/verse&gt;
&lt;verse osisID="Mark.10.10"&gt;When they were in the house again, the
disciples asked Jesus about this. &lt;/verse&gt;
&lt;verse osisID="Mark.10.11"&gt;He answered, "Anyone who divorces his wife
and marries another woman commits adultery against her. &lt;/verse&gt;
&lt;verse osisID="Mark.10.12"&gt;And if she divorces her husband and
marries another man, she commits adultery." &lt;/verse&gt;

&lt;verse osisID="Esth.4.10"&gt;Then Esther spoke to Hathach, and gave him
a command for Mordecai: &lt;/verse&gt;

&lt;verse osisID="Esth.4.11"&gt;&lt;q&gt;All the king's servants and the people
of the king's provinces know that any man or woman who goes into the
inner court to the king, who has not been called, he has but one law:
put all to death, except the one to whom the king holds out the
golden scepter, that he may live. Yet I myself have not been called
to go in to the king these thirty days.&lt;/q&gt; &lt;/verse&gt;

&lt;verse osisID="Esth.4.12"&gt;So they told Mordecai Esther's words.
&lt;/verse&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;verse osisID="Esth.4.13"&gt;And Mordecai told them to answer Esther:
"Do not think in your heart that you will escape in the king's palace
any more than all the other Jews. &lt;/verse&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;verse osisID="Esth.4.14"&gt;For if you remain completely silent at this
time, relief and deliverance will arise for the Jews from another
place, but you and your father's house will perish. Yet who knows
whether you have come to the kingdom for such a time as this?"
&lt;/verse&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;verse osisID="Esth.4.15"&gt;Then Esther told them to reply to Mordecai: &lt;/verse&gt;
&lt;q&gt;
&lt;verse osisID="Esth.4.16"&gt;"Go, gather all the Jews who are present in
Shushan, and fast for me; neither eat nor drink for three days, night
or day. My maids and I will fast likewise. And so I will go to the
king, which is against the law; and if I perish, I perish!
&lt;/verse&gt;&lt;/q&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

            Notice in this example that all the paragraphs and quotations still
            enclose an exact number of verses; there are exceptions to this
            elsewhere in the Bible, that need special handling as explained later.

            When tagging quotations, do not also include quotation marks. They
            will be generated in the typesetting or display process. This is
            important for several reasons. FIrst, if some people use <b>q</b>, some use punctuation marks, and some use both,
            anyone processing OSIS texts will have to check every text and
            account for all the variations -- this is expensive and
            time-consuming: that is, it will make the Bibles cost more (to
            someone), and be delivered later. Another reason is that punctuation
            for quotes differs around the world; so any given quotation mark may
            be meaningless to other communities. In Spanish, for example, there
            are special rules about how to mark quotes that continue after an
            interruption -- such cases can be distinguished by adding a <b>type</b>
            attribute to the <b>q</b> element, with values such as initial, medial,
            and final.

         <p><a name="d0e1679"></a>
            Many editions of the Bible have accompanying notes, often of several
            distinct types. A number of predefined types, and some additional
            internal structure, are discussed later. It is customary to include
            the notes directly within the text, at the point to which they apply.
            This can be done via the <b>note</b> element, which can
            be placed almost anywhere. In the future, it is likely that notes
            will more commonly reside outside of the text, instead residing in
            special notes-files that can be attached (via <b>osisRef</b>) to any Bible
            edition on request.

            Every <b>note</b> should have a <b>type</b>
            attribute to indicate its purpose; many Bible editions show different
            kinds of notes in different places. The pre-defined note types are
            listed below; they are not sharply-defined, wholly distinct
            categories. In addition, if none of these categories suffice,
            encoders may create their own so long as their names begin with "x-".

            </li>
            <li class="body"><a name="d0e1706"></a><b>alternative</b> The note records an alternate possible reading of

               variation.
            </li>

               original readers would have known, and so on.
            </li>

               and other performance texts, where the performer may wish to make notes to him or herself. For
               example, "tell joke here".

               as a word whose meanining is unclear in the original, or a reasons
               for the translator's choice of phrasing. Bible translation projects
               will likely use this heavily, using the subtype attribute to mark the
               status of each note as resolved or unresolved, the person responsible
               for the note, and so on.
            </li>
            <li class="body"><a name="d0e1776"></a><b>variant</b> The note records a textual variation in manuscript
               tradition, relevant at its location.

         <p><a name="d0e1784"></a>Sometimes a <b>verse</b> or <b>chapter</b>
            starts or end in the middle of some other unit, such as a poetic line
            group, paragraph, quotation, or speech. In such cases an alternate
            form of the <b>verse</b> or <b>chapter</b>
            tags must be used. This usage is explained in the next section.

         <p><a name="d0e1804"></a>The normal form of an element is a start tag and an end tag: <b>&lt;verse&gt;...&lt;/verse&gt;</b>. For handling markup
            that crosses boundaries, however, a special form must be used. It
            consists of two totally empty instances of the same element type: one
            to mark the starting point, and one to mark the ending point. The two
            empty elements identify themselves as to which is the start and which is
            the end, and co-identify themselves by the <b>sID</b>
                 attribute (the start of the traditional element) and the <b>eID</b> attribute (the end of the traditional
                element), the values of which must match.

         <p>Empty elements are indicated in XML by a tag with "/" preceding the

                 "milestones", and those particular elements in OSIS that permit
                 this alternate encoding are thus called "milestoneable". Elements

         <p><a name="d0e1874"></a>This is particularly useful where modern translations break up
                 verses or other traditional divisions in a Bible text. For
                 example, a paragraph based encoding of part of the Book of Esther
                 would appears as follows:
         </p>
         
         <pre class="eg">

&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;verse sID="Esth.2.7" osisID="Esth.2.7"/&gt;Mordecai had a very beautiful cousin named Esther, whose Hebrew name was Hadassah. He had raised her as his own daughter, after her father and mother died.&lt;verse eID="Esth.2.7"/&gt;
	&lt;verse sID="Esth.2.8" osisID="Esth.2.8"/&gt;When the king ordered the search for beautiful women, many were taken to the king's palace in Susa, and Esther was one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hegai was put in charge of all the women,&lt;verse eID="Esth.2.8"/&gt;
	&lt;verse sID="Esth.2.9" osisID="Esth.2.9"/&gt;and from the first day, Esther was his favorite. He began her beauty treatments at once. He also gave her plenty of food and seven special maids from the king's palace, and they had the best rooms.&lt;verse eID="Esth.2.9"/&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

    </pre>
         
         <p>There are two things to note about the Esther example:
            
            
         </p>
         <ul>
            <li class="body"><a name="d0e1884"></a>Esther 2:8 is divided by a paragraph (the <b>p</b> element and so must be marked using the <b>verse</b> element as a milestones with the <b>sID</b> and <b>eID</b> attributes
               	to link those two milestones together.
            </li>
            <li class="body"><a name="d0e1899"></a>Where overlapping elements are necessary, the milestoneable
                      element technique must be used for the entire text. That is, it
                      is an error to mark some verses in Esther with traditional <b>verse</b> elements, i.e., as containers and others
                      with the milestoneable verses. The reason is quite simple,
                      inconsistent markup is more difficult to process and makes the
                      encoded text less useful for everyone.
            </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
                
         </p>
         
         
         <p><a name="d0e1907"></a>
            This is equivalent to the TEI "milestone" method for marking such
            phenomena. It has the advantage that milestones representing a given
            type of element have the same name as the element, and automatically
            have the same attributes. Although XML itself will not detect a
            validation error if attributes other than <b>eID</b> are
            specified on the ending <b>milestone</b>, <b>eID</b> is specified on the starting <b>milestone</b>, or the start and end milestones are in the
            wrong order, each of these conditions is an OSIS error.
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p><a name="d0e1922"></a>
            For OSIS purposes, there is no semantic difference between marking up
            a chapter or verse as a container using a start and end tag, versus
            marking it up as a "milestone pair" consisting of two empty tags.
            
         </p>
         
         
         
         
         <p><a name="d0e1925"></a>Note: Typesetting and layout systems vary in their ability to
            accommodate non-hierarchical markup such as this. Fortunately, in
            most Bible editions the only formatting consequence of a <b>verse</b> element is insertion of the verse number, and
            perhaps insertion of a line-break; these are within the capabilities
            of most layout and style systems even though the verse is not a
            container in XML terms.

         <p><a name="d0e1938"></a>The bulk of the remaining OSIS elements fall into a few simple

               Letters, epistles, and similar texts are marked up in basically the

               <p><a name="d0e1952"></a>The <b>salute</b> element encloses the salutation or
                  greeting, typically at the very beginning of a letter. It should
                  include the whole salutation, including (if present) the "to",
                  "from", and any following greeting or blessing. If the boundaries of
                  a salutation are the same as the boundaries of a paragraph, section,
                  or other unit, that unit should be placed outside, with the salute

            </h3>
            
            
            <p><a name="d0e2108"></a>
               OSIS provides two main features for marking up dramatic texts: A way
               to declare the list of characters, or <b>castList</b>;
               and a way to identify speeches and speakers in the body of a dramatic
               text.
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p><a name="d0e2114"></a>
               A <b>castList</b> element contains a structured list of
               the roles, or cast, of a dramatic work. It is drawn directly from the
               TEI structure for the same thing. For example, in the Song of Songs,
               some translations may present the list of characters at the start of
               the book: lover, beloved, and friends. The same might be done for
               Job. However, these elements will be most commonly used for
               extra-Biblical materials, such as a play based on the Bible, or
               dramas in classical or other literature.
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p><a name="d0e2120"></a>
               A simple example of a castList is shown below, perhaps for a dramatic
               re-enactment of Job:
               
            </p>
            
            <pre class="eg">

&lt;castList&gt;
    &lt;castGroup&gt;
       &lt;head&gt;Cast of characters&lt;/head&gt;
       &lt;castItem&gt;
          &lt;actor&gt;Patrick Durusau&lt;/actor&gt;
          &lt;role&gt;Job&lt;/role&gt;
          &lt;roleDesc&gt;A man of God who suffers greatly&lt;/roleDesc&gt;
       &lt;/castItem&gt;

       &lt;castItem&gt;
          &lt;actor&gt;(a whirlwind)&lt;/actor&gt;
          &lt;role&gt;God&lt;/role&gt;
          &lt;roleDesc&gt;The Almighty, who permits Job's suffering, and
          responds to his questions about it.&lt;/roleDesc&gt;
       &lt;/castItem&gt;

       &lt;castItem&gt;
          &lt;actor&gt;(a disembodied voice)&lt;/actor&gt;
          &lt;role&gt;Satan&lt;/role&gt;
          &lt;roleDesc&gt;The instigator of Job's suffering&lt;/roleDesc&gt;
       &lt;/castItem&gt;

       &lt;castItem&gt;
          &lt;actor&gt;Todd Tillinghast&lt;/actor&gt;
          &lt;role&gt;Eliphaz&lt;/role&gt;
          &lt;roleDesc&gt;The first of Job's friends to speak&lt;/roleDesc&gt;
       &lt;/castItem&gt;

       &lt;castItem&gt;
          &lt;actor&gt;Chris Little&lt;/actor&gt;
          &lt;role&gt;Bildad&lt;/role&gt;
          &lt;roleDesc&gt;The second of Job's friends to speak&lt;/roleDesc&gt;
       &lt;/castItem&gt;

       &lt;castItem&gt;
          &lt;actor&gt;Steve DeRose&lt;/actor&gt;
          &lt;role&gt;Zophar&lt;/role&gt;
          &lt;roleDesc&gt;The third of Job's friends to speak&lt;/roleDesc&gt;
       &lt;/castItem&gt;

       &lt;castItem&gt;
          &lt;actor&gt;Troy Griffiths&lt;/actor&gt;
          &lt;role&gt;Elihu&lt;/role&gt;
          &lt;roleDesc&gt;The youngest and last of Job's friends to speak,
          who was slightly less clueless than the rest.&lt;/roleDesc&gt;
       &lt;/castItem&gt;
    &lt;/castGroup&gt;
&lt;/castList&gt;

</pre>
            
            <p><a name="d0e2126"></a>
               The <b>castList</b> element contains the entire casting
               List, and consists of one or more <b>castGroup</b>
               elements. Multiple castGroups, each with its own head, would be used
               if there were multiple sub-groups of the cast to be listed
               separately; more typically there will be only one <b>castGroup</b> within a <b>castList</b>.
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p><a name="d0e2141"></a>
               At this time, <b>castList</b> can only occur in a <b>work</b> declaration, after the Dublin Core elements.
               Thus, if a Bible encoder wishes to include the casts of Song of Songs
               and of Job, they would each need to be marked as a separate <b>castGroup</b> within that one <b>castList</b>.
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p><a name="d0e2156"></a>
               The <b>castItem</b> element contains the full information
               for a single character. This must include a name for the <b>role</b> being played, and should include a <b>roleDesc</b>, that is, a description of that role. It may
               also include the name of an <b>actor</b>, if the text
               being encoded represents a particular enactment rather than, say, a
               libretto or script.
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p><a name="d0e2171"></a>
               In general there is no need to also encode an actor name or role name
               with an explicit <b>name</b> element, unless the encoder
               wishes to provide a normalized form for later reference; in that
               case, the <b>name</b> element would be placed just <i>within</i> the <b>actor</b> or <b>role</b> element, not surrounding it.
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p><a name="d0e2189"></a>
               It is strongly recommended that each <b>castGroup</b> and
               <b>castItem</b> have an <b>ID</b> attribute.
               Since IDs must be unique across all element types in a document,
               encoders may wish to prefix certain kinds of IDs to separate them and
               avoid conflicts. For example, an appropriate ID for a <b>castItem</b> representing the Friends in Song of Songs
               would be "cast.friends", or perhaps "cast.song.friends".

            <p><a name="d0e2221"></a>Either method is correct but careful encoders will choose one or

            <p><a name="d0e2229"></a>The speech element is used to indicate quoted direct speech. In
               that sense it represents a kind of quotation. However, the <b>q</b> element is to be used for quotations in general,
               where the <b>speech</b> element is limited to accounts of
               an individual making an actual speech in some kind of performance
               context. In general, both elements should not be applied to the same
               text portion. Just as with the <b>q</b> element, using
               the <b>speech</b> element makes quotation marks
               unnecessary, and they must not be used. For example:

&lt;chapter osisID="Acts.7"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;Stephen's Speech to the Sanhedrin&lt;/head&gt;

&lt;verse osisID="Acts.7.1" sID="a71"/&gt;Then the high priest asked him, &lt;speech&gt;Are
these charges true?&lt;/speech&gt;
&lt;verse eID="a71"&gt;

&lt;verse osisID="Acts.7.2" sID="a72"/&gt;To this he replied:
&lt;speech&gt;Brothers and fathers, listen to me! The God of glory appeared
to our father Abraham while he was still in Mesopotamia, before he
lived in Haran. &lt;verse eID='a72'/&gt;

&lt;verse osisID="Acts.7.3" sID="a73"&gt;'Leave your country and your people,' God
said, 'and go to the land I will show you.'&lt;verse eID="a73"/&gt;

&lt;verse osisID="Acts.7.4" sID="a74"/&gt;"So he left the land of the Chaldeans and
settled in Haran. After the death of his father, God sent him to this
land where you are now living. &lt;verse eID="a74"/&gt;

&lt;verse osisID="Acts.7.5" sID="a75"/&gt;He gave him no inheritance here, not even a
foot of ground. But God promised him that he and his descendants
after him would possess the land, even though at that time Abraham
had no child. &lt;verse eID="a75"/&gt;

&lt;verse osisID="Acts.7.6" sID="a76"/&gt;God spoke to him in this way: 'Your
descendants will be strangers in a country not their own, and they
will be enslaved and mistreated four hundred years. &lt;verse eID="a76"/&gt;

&lt;verse osisID="Acts.7.7" sID="a77"/&gt;But I will punish the nation they serve as
slaves,' God said, 'and afterward they will come out of that country
and worship me in this place.'&lt;verse eID="a77"/&gt;

&lt;verse osisID="Acts.7.8" sID="a78"/&gt;Then he gave Abraham the covenant of
circumcision. And Abraham became the father of Isaac and circumcised
him eight days after his birth. Later Isaac became the father of
Jacob, and Jacob became the father of the twelve
patriarchs.&lt;verse eID="a78"/&gt;

...

&lt;verse osisID="Acts.7.53" sID="a79"/&gt;you who have received the law that was put
into effect through angels but have not obeyed it.

...&lt;/chapter&gt;


</pre>
            
            <p><a name="d0e2247"></a>Note that in this example the high priest's short speech in verse 1
               is marked up as a normal container element with normal start- and
               end-tags, as is Stephen's reply. But, note that all the verse
               boundaries have been repesented with milestoneable verse elements. The
               reason for this is quite simple, if the encoding jumps from using
               containers for verses and only on occassion changes to milestones,
               noting that Stephen's speech start inside a verse, the file becomes
               very difficult to process reliably.  When a conflict arises between
               the scope of chapter/verse units and other units, the chapter/verse
               units give way by being represented as milestones. If a conflict
               arises between two other units (say, a quote that encompasses part but
               not all of each of two paragraphs), it is left to the encoder's
               discretion which or them is represented via milestones.

            </h3>
            
            
            <p><a name="d0e2255"></a>
               Although poetic material is commonly called "verse" material, OSIS
               avoids that term because of potential confusion with the
               book/chapter/verse reference system. Thus, like "TEI," markup of poetry
               refers to lines and line groups.
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p><a name="d0e2258"></a>
               In addition, OSIS provides a typographic line-break element. This is
               because in at least some editions of the Bible, the exact placement
               of typographic line-breaks within poetic lines is considered very
               important; while on the other hand it is determined in part by
               presentational concerns (for example, column width), rather than by
               linguistic characteristics of either the source or target language.
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p><a name="d0e2261"></a>
               OSIS provides three main elements for marking up poetic material:

               </h4>
               
               <p><a name="d0e2268"></a>The <b>lg</b> or "line group" element is used to contain any group of
                  poetic lines. Thus it covers for units like couplet, stanza, and
                  entire poem. Line groups can contain smaller line groups as well.

               <p><a name="d0e2279"></a>The <b>l</b> element is used to mark poetic lines, as determined by the
                  linguistic nature of poetry in the language of the work. For example,
                  much English poetry consists of lines that can be located by the
                  position of rhyming words, and/or by counting syllables; Hebrew poety
                  can often be divided into lines based on parallelism of thought or
                  meaning.

               <p><a name="d0e2285"></a>The following example shows an encoding of the first two verses of
                  	  Psalm 7 from the CEV which uses the <b>lg</b>
                  	  and <b>l</b> elements to mark poetic
                  	  material.

               <p><a name="d0e2302"></a>The <b>lb</b> element, or "line break", is used to mark line breaks that
                  are not the result of linguistically or poetically significant
                  structure, but are primarily part of the typography and layout. For
                  example, a lone line might be broken to fit into a narrow column. The
                  lb element is an empty element used to mark where such breaks
                  occurred in an important copy text, or where they should be placed in
                  a text to be rendered.

               <p><a name="d0e2310"></a>
                  Bible typesetting has a long tradition involving placement of such
                  breaks. In some cases, translators have carefully decided preferred
                  or required break-points for various set widths. These can be
                  accommodated by using the type attribute of lb. For example,
                  type="wide-pref" and type="narrow-pref" might be used to identify the
                  locations of preferred line-breaks for wide and narrow column
                  layouts. Similarly, type might be used to distinguish various levels
                  of indentation following the break, or other typographic factors
                  deemed important.

               <p><a name="d0e2313"></a>
                  The <b>lb</b> element should not be used merely to record where line breaks
                  in general happened to occur in a source edition. For most source
                  editions this information is unimportant; for manuscripts it may be
                  imortant, but must be marked up using the milestone element instead.

               Simple glossaries such as appear at the back of many Bibles, may be
               encoded at this time using the simple <b>list</b>, <b>label</b>, <b>item</b> elements
               described below. A dicitonary extension is well along in development,
               and should be available as an extension module within the next few
               months. That module should be used for any but the simplest lexical
               tools; and once available, OSIS may decide to recommend against
               further use of list to represent even simple glossaries.

               used to mark point events in a text, often involving the layout of
               the original text, or special points of access into the electronic

               between those units, rather than just within either one.
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p><a name="d0e2511"></a>When setting attribute n on a <b>milestone</b>, it should indicate the
               number of the unit starting, not the unit ending. For example,
               &lt;milestone type="page" n="3"/&gt; indicates the break between
               pages 2 and 3, not between pages 3 and 4. Numbering does not need to
               be unique across various types of milestones -- for example, the 24th
               line on page 5 of a manuscript may be marked simpley n="5", rather
               than n="24.5" or similar.

            <p><a name="d0e2517"></a>Several predefined types are provided for the <b>milestone</b> element
                     (the value for the <b>type</b> attribute is shown
                     in bold):

                  <p><a name="d0e2533"></a>Marks the location of a page break in the source text.

               <li class="body"><a name="d0e2536"></a><b>column </b> 
                  <p><a name="d0e2541"></a>Marks the
                     location of a column break in the source text. Assuming page
                     boundaries are also marked, the start of the first column need not be
                     marked unless something else (such as a footer) precedes it in the
                     encoding of the page. Columns should be numbered in the order of
                     reading (for example, right to left in Hebrew texts). In the case of,
                     say, an English/Hebrew diglot edition, where there is no principled
                     order of reading among the columns, the direction used for the pages
                     (Hebrew or Greek) should be considered the dominant direction, and the
                     same direction should be used for numbering columns.

                     page header if it is being included in the encoded text. This would
                     normally be true only for digitized editions of manuscripts or other
                     important copy editions, because in modern print Bibles headers are
                     typically automatically generated.

                     text when they are considered significant. This will normally only be
                     true for important manuscripts, where line numbering may be needed
                     for paleographic or reference use. Line milestones must not be used
                     to represent linguistically significant line breaks, such as in
                     poetry, for which the lg and l elements are provided.

                  <p><a name="d0e2581"></a>The milestone of type "screen" is to be used to mark preferred
                     break points in an on-screen rendering of the text. For example, if
                     the user requests to be taken to the book of Psalms in a given
                     electronic edition, it may be best not to take them to Psalm.1.1, but
                     to an earlier point, preceding any introductory material. In many
                     cases this can be accomplished by taking them to the appropriate div
                     (since the &lt;div type="book" osisID="Ps"&gt; should precede and
                     Psalms-specific introductory material); but this milestone type is
                     available for other cases. The OSIS specification does not impose
                     requirements on how applications make use of such
                     milestones.

            <p><a name="d0e2726"></a>Provides simple text highlighting capability; types that can be
               distinguished as to their purpose (emphasis, marking of interpolated
               or transliterated foreign words, boldness for headings, etc.) must
               instead be marked using the appropriate, more specific, element. The
               <b>hi</b> element (short for "highlighted") is reserved for cases where the
               purpose of the highlighting or other typographic distinction is
               unclear, or known to be unimportant.

            <p>The type attribute on the <b>hi</b> element allows
               the user to specify what typographic distinction was observed in the
               text. As noted above this is not meant as a guide for stylesheets but
               for recording what was observed. If it is known with reasonable
               certainty why a word or phrase appears in italic, for example a
               foreign phrase, then the <b>foreign</b> element should
               be use to mark it. To enable consistency in the marking of such
               distinct texts, the OSIS schema provides seven (7) standards values
               for the type attribute on the <b>hi</b> element as

               provided by the OSIS schema. For example, the lowest level of division

               of the schema, it is presumed that a word is distinguished by being
               bounded on either side by white space. The OSIS core team was aware
               that such a definition is too crude to be useful for a number of
               modern and ancient languages and intends to address that issue in a
               future release of the schema.

               suffixes, morphemes, the <b>seg</b> element is the correct element to
               be used. It can also be used, with caution, to mark a textual
               feature that is not otherwise provided for by the schema. It should be
               noted that this element can only contain very small elements and

               	 note applies. 3. The <b>rdg</b> element holds an

               	 of Sharon (northern Israel) in biblical times.

               the Aplified Bible has several punctuation conventions for marking

            A canonical refererence scheme is a system of agreed names and/or
            numbers for for referring to parts of a document. In the Bible, the
            traditional system used in most languages consists of a book name
            (such as Genesis), then a chapter number, then a verse number. Most
            works of Classical literature have similar schemes, nearly all of
            which are also hierarchical (that is, they work from larger units to
            smaller).

            The basic form for Biblical verse references is strictly defined by
            OSIS, so that various electronic Bible versions can interoperate
            easily. Standard abbreviations for the canonical and deuterocanonical
            books are provided; chapter and verse numbers follow the book
            abbreviation separated by periods. For example:
            
         </p>
         
         <pre class="eg">
    Matt.1.1
</pre>
         
         
         <p><a name="d0e3072"></a>
            OSIS uses such identifiers in several places:
            
         </p>
         
         
         <ul>
            <li class="body"><a name="d0e3077"></a>To identify a portion of text from an actual canonical
               work, such as a verse of the Bible. The verse element bears an <b>osisID</b>
               attribute which must include the identifier appropriate to the verse.
               For example, &lt;v osisID="Matt.1.1"&gt;&gt;....
            </li>
            <li class="body"><a name="d0e3083"></a>To identify a reference <b>into</b> a
               Biblical or other passage, that is not contained at the point of
               reference. For example, "&lt;p&gt;The correctness of my exegesis is
               incontrovertibly proven by &lt;reference osisRef="Matt.1.1"&gt;the
               first verse of Matthew.&lt;/p&gt;"
            </li>
            <li class="body"><a name="d0e3089"></a>In the header, to identify what portions of the Bible
               are included in a declared work. For example, a particular edition

               number "1" must be specified:  The first verse of Jude is thus
               Jude.1.1, not Jude.1.
               
            </p>

               A reference can also identify a place in a particular edition or
               translation of the Bible, or to other works entirely, such as
               Josephus, writing of the Apostolic fathers, classical or modern
               literature, and so on. We discuss later how to declare particular
               works and give them local short names. Once that is done, the short
               name for any declared work can be put before any reference to it, for
               example:
               
            </p>
            
            <pre class="eg">
    NIV:Matt.1.1
</pre>
            
            <p><a name="d0e3126"></a>
               The colon is required, to make it is clear where the work ends and
               the within-work reference begins. Most commonly, however, the work is
               omitted (the default work used then is whatever work was named on the
               osisWorkID attribute of the osisText element).
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p><a name="d0e3129"></a>
               It is possible to refer to an entire work, such as the whole CEV,
               NIV, KJV, the Iliad, etc. However, to do so the work name must be
               stated, and the following colon must be included (without the colon,
               it would be interpreted as a top-level identifier within the default work).
               
            </p>

               Translations also often split verses into parts, provided labels such
               as "a" and "b" for the separate parts. Encoders may freely add
               sub-identifiers below the lowest standardized level. They are set off
               from the standardized portion by the character "!" (as opposed to "."
               between levels of the standard system). For example:
               
            </p>
            
            <pre class="eg">
      Rev.2.20!b
</pre>
            
            <p><a name="d0e3143"></a>
               Such subdivisions are not standard across different translations, so
               applications must be prepared to discard them when trying to locate a
               referenced location in a different edition.
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p><a name="d0e3146"></a>
               These extensions are not considered a formal part of the canonical
               reference scheme, and so a work that uses them need not claim it is
               using a different scheme.

            <p><a name="d0e3154"></a>
               Translators often group several adjacent verses into a single block,
               so that they can translate them using word order more natural in the
               target language. In such cases, the larger unit (commonly a paragraph
               or p element), gets an osisID that lists all the individual osisIDs
               for the verses included, separated by white space. For example:
               
            </p>
            
            <pre class="eg">
    &lt;p osisID="Matt.1.1 Matt.1.2 Matt.1.3"&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
</pre>
            
            <p><a name="d0e3160"></a>
               osisIDs never allow the use of ranges. Only osisRefs (discussed later) do.
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p><a name="d0e3163"></a>Ranges are prohibited for osisIDs in order to simplify
               implementation of tools that search for particular passages by
               reference. If an encoder wished to mark IDs at, say, the pericope
               level, the markup would be quite verbose because many verses would
               need to be listed in a single attribute on the div type="pericope".
               However, there is no need to do this if the verses within the
               pericope are themselves identified. 
            </p>

               The "."-separated parts of an <b>osisID</b> are defined to represent a
               hierarchy. In the traditional versification (introduced by William
               Whittingham in his New Testament published in Geneva in 1557), these
               would be book, chapter, and verse numbers. In other schemes for the
               Bible, or schemes for entirely different works, the names of the parts
               may differ, but the expectation is that they still form a hierarchy.
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p><a name="d0e3177"></a>
               The parts of an <b>osisID</b> may contain any mixture of numbers, letters,
               and underscores. However, to avoid conflict with the other
               punctuations used (such as ":" to separate the work from the in-work
               location, "@" to separate fine-grained references in osisRefs, and "!"
               to separate work-specific extensions to a versification scheme), no
               other characters are allowed.
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p><a name="d0e3183"></a> The <b>!</b> as the terminator, allows encoders to append names and/or
               numbers to provide finer-grained reference points. Such extensions may
                     not be valid across reference systems so should be used with care.
               
            </p>

               As with XML in general, these identifiers are case-sensitive: "Matt"
               is the correct form, and there is no Bible book in OSIS that is
               called "matt" or "MATT". Applications for end users may choose to
               accept case variants in such names, but applications for encoders
               (such as OSIS editors) must not produce documents with invalid
               reference names.

               A work may provide identifiers drawn from multiple distinct
               versification schemes. A Bible may wish to provide both the Hebrew
               and Greek traditional verse numberings; while a work of classical
               literature may be made more accessible by marking the boundaries of
               canonical units drawn from completely unrelated systems, such as Loeb
               and Whiston for Josephus (and 4 more systems for Josephus' Jewish War
               specifically -- see H. Douglas Buckwalter and Mary K. Shoaff, Guide
               to Reference Systems for the Works of Flavious Josephus, Evangelical
               Theological Society, 1995, ISBN 093205501X).

            <p><a name="d0e3200"></a>The <b>work</b> element is not required for the

            <p><a name="d0e3209"></a>
               A simpler case may also arise where multiple reference schemes are in
               use: an <b>osisCorpus</b> that includes several osisTexts, each of which
               uses a different reference scheme. This case is simpler, since each
               <b>osisText</b> can provide its own default reference system, using the
               <b>osisRefWork</b> attribute on <b>osisText</b>.
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p><a name="d0e3224"></a>
               This is accomplished in the same way as just described for discursive
               translations: the multiple identifiers are simply placed where
               needed, separated by spaces when they co-occur on a single element.
               Each reference system used much be declared as a work in the header,
               and each identifier much indicate the reference system from which it
               is drawn. For example, a line of Josephus that has two distinct
               identifiers would appear like this (presuming the appropriate work
               declarations in the header):
               
            </p>
            
            <pre class="eg">
    &lt;l osisID="josephus-war:loeb:245.22 josephus-war:whiston:22.3.14b"&gt;
</pre>
            
            <p><a name="d0e3230"></a>
               Because verse, chapter, and similar elements can be expressed by
               empty-element pairs when necessary, it is possible to encode multiple
               reference systems even though they may have completely unrelated
               start and end points for their units. For example, a work that has
               one reference system based on sentences, and another based on lines
               of a normative print edition, can co-exist. However, taken to
               extremes this would get rather messy, and be difficult to maintain
               without OSIS-aware software to assist.

         <p><a name="d0e3241"></a>
            An <b>osisRef</b> is very much like an <b>osisID</b>. The fundamental
            difference is that while an <b>osisID</b> <strong>identifies</strong> the actual
            occurrence of canonical text, an <b>osisRef</b> is used to <strong>refer</strong> to
            canonical text from somewhere else. For example, a footnote
            (particularly one of type="crossReference") may refer to a related
            passage, or a section heading in Mark may include references to
            the parallel passages in Matthew and Luke; in such cases an <b>osisRef</b>
            rather than an <b>osisID</b> is used.
            
         </p>
         
         
         
         <p><a name="d0e3268"></a>
            Any valid <b>osisID</b> value is also a valid <b>osisRef</b> value, and refers to the same
            thing. Thus for example, a commentary might say:
            
         </p>
         
         <pre class="eg">
    &lt;p&gt;The same interpretive method applies also in &lt;reference
    osisRef="Luke.1.1"&gt;the first verse of Luke&lt;/reference&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
</pre>
         
         
         <p><a name="d0e3280"></a>
            However, osisRefs provide additional capabilities. They can refer to
            a contiguous range of books, chapters, verses (or other units, as
            applicable to the work being referenced), and they can refer to
            precise locations within a given canonically-reference unit.
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p><a name="d0e3283"></a>
            To refer to a range, simply include two <b>osisID</b>s, one for the first
            verse (or chapter or book) of the range, and one for the last.
            Separate the 2 values by a single hyphen (white space is also
            permitted, but not recommended, on either or both sides of the
            hyphen). For example:
            
         </p>
         
         <pre class="eg">
    John.3.14-John.3.16
    Prov.30-Prov.31
    Esth-Song
    Ps.149-Prov.3.4
</pre>
         
         <p><a name="d0e3292"></a>
            Both sides of the hyphen must hold complete references. It is not
            correct to abbreviate the first example above to merely
            "John.3.14-16" (as always, the values of <b>osisID</b> and <b>osisRef</b>
            attributes need not be the same values displayed to the reader).
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p><a name="d0e3301"></a>
            A single osisRef cannot identify a discontiguous range of a work. For
            example, a complex reference such as "John 3:14-16, 18; 4:1-2; 19-20"
            cannot be encoded as a single reference. It must instead be encoded
            as several parts, each contiguous:
            
         </p>
         
         <pre class="eg">

               cp (short for "code point") counts through the character content of
               the referenced element, essentially by characters. Technically, the
               units counted are Unicode code points, a term which is defined more
               precisely than the generic term "character". The first code point of
               content is number 1, not 0.

               When referring to a location in canonical content, text within
               non-canonical elements is not counted. (Thus, the intuitive count will
               not be changed by the insertion of notes, references, critical
               apparatus, and the like). When referring to a location in

         <p><a name="d0e3352"></a>
            Hebrew tradition numbers the proscriptions above Psalms (such as "A
            Maskil according to David") as verse one, and goes on from there;
            Greek tradition does not number the proscriptions, and start verse 1
            after it. Of course, this would make all references in Psalms be off
            by one verse if the version reached is from the other tradition.
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p><a name="d0e3355"></a>
            A few languages use traditional reference schemes that completely
            differ from the familiar book/chapter/verse one.
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p><a name="d0e3358"></a>
            Many works of Classical literature likewise have more than one
            standard canonical reference scheme, such a Loeb numbers plus another
            method.
            
         </p>
         
         
         
         <p><a name="d0e3361"></a>
            In such cases, where there are large and systematic differences,
            different "versification schemes" must be defined and named. On the
            other hand, nearly every edition of the Bible has some slight
            deviations from a standard versification scheme that it otherwise
            follows: for example, subdividing verses into parts "a" and "b",
            combining verses into a larger translation unit, and so on. It is
            highly undesirable to call these separate versification schemes,
            because they differ so slightly; because the differences can be
            mechanically resolved; and because there is considerably overhead to
            maintaining and mapping among versification schemes. Thus, as
            described below such minor extensions can be done without an edition
            having to say it is using a completely different versification scheme.

            BTG intends to develop an XML schema for declaration files that can
            express such systems, and their mapping to other systems. This work
            has not been completed. However, we have reserved names for the major
                 versification systems, see: <i>XML and OSIS
                     declarations</i> above.

         <p><a name="d0e3370"></a>
            Each work must identify which versification scheme(s) it uses; this is
            done by a reference to the versification scheme declared by a <b>work</b> declaration in the header except that the predefined
            versification systems need not have work declarations.

         <p><a name="d0e3376"></a>
            References can also state what versification scheme they are
            expressed in, so that they may be correctly interpreted.

            HTML may provide targets that look like canonical Bible references,

               which for example may fix typos in the original, normalize spelling
               of older texts, and so on. However, in such cases it is recommended

               A Trusted Quality document must fulfill all the requirements of a

               least one year, and read by at least 5 independent proofreaders, with
               all noted errors fixed. The text should have available a complete log
               of changes made since it reached Proof Quality. Random spot-checks of
               at least 3% of the text must come up with no instances of more than 1

         <p><a name="d0e3563"></a>
            Applications should avoid making any processing distinctions between
            elements represented as non-crossing single elements or as milestone
            pairs.
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p><a name="d0e3566"></a>Applications must interpret OSIS references as accurately as is
            feasible, but apply smart fallback as needed. For example, grains
            will not map across translations or languages, though most will
            typically survive changes between successive editions of the same
            text, or differences between British and American English versions.
            Applications should in general at least offer to take the user to the
            nearest reliably-findable place; in this case, the verse. 
         </p>
         
         
         <p><a name="d0e3569"></a>
            Applications must be able to interpret the OSIS elements and process
            them in a manner consistent with their express intent as specified in
            this document, and in accordance with standard practices of Bible
            publishing. For example, applications should be capable of
            distinguishing the typography used for inscriptions, the divine Name,
            verse labels and references, foreign insertions in the text, notes,
            and so on in ways readily recognizable to users of print Bibles.

         <p><a name="d0e3572"></a>
            The Bible Technologies group also strongly advocates making all
            software, and especially all OSIS-aware software, accessible to
            print-disabled users. This includes details such as providing text
            alternates for all graphics, not marking up poetry such that it can
            only be line-broken given certain line widths or font sizes; not
            making crucial distinctions only via color, subtleties of font, etc.;
            and not using tables gratuitously to achieve formatting goals rather
            than to represent truly tabular information. Subtle technical factors
            can also ruin otherwise accessible software, for example, the order
            in which panes are drawn. Implementors are strongly encouraged to
            consult with experts on accessibility, and obtain specific critical
            testing and review by print-disabled users before finalizing product
            releases. The Bible Technology will, as resources permit, be glad to
            help connect implementors with accessibility experts.

         <p><a name="d0e5424"></a>The osisRef regex is over twice as long as the osisID regex, in
                 part because of the addiional capabilities of an osisRef. The
                 allowable characters are basically the same but there are some
                 nuances to constructing an osisRef. The following guide should
                 get you past all of the common cases, and even a few of the odder
                 ones.

                     underscore, that may be followed by any number of letters,
                     numbers or underscores, separated by periods, and concluding in
                     a colon ":". Note that if you use a prefix, the colon is
                     required. The prefix is <b>optional</b>.

                     the OSIS text where you are inserting the osisRef. This is the
                     equivalent of the osisID without a prefix, it defaults to the
                     text that you are working in at the moment. For purposed of

                     displayed to the reader of a OSIS text, but use of whitespace as
                     a separator (between Gen. and chapter 1, in XML causes
                     problems. So, the whitespace was replaced by a period.

               systems are well known and should be covered by the main part of the

            </h3>
            
            <p><a name="d0e5528"></a>One shortcoming of most reference systems is the inability to point
                     to a particular place in a line of text. This is of particular
                     interest for Bible study, where the user wants to point to a
                     particular word in a passage, not the entire passage
                     itself. OSIS developed a syntax that follows the prefix, main
                     osisRef and even the extension (if present) that allows you to
                     do exactly that.
            </p>
            
            <p><a name="d0e5531"></a>The grain operators come in two types: 1) <b>cp</b>, which allows you to
                     point at a particular character in the text, and 2) <b>s</b>, which
                     allows you to point at a string of characters. It is probably
                     easier to illustrate these separately.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>The <b>cp</b> grain operator is a number, enclosed by square brackets and
                     preceded by the "@" sign, all of which follows, at a mimimum,
                     the main part of an osisRef. For example:
               
               
            </p>
            <ul>
               <li class="body"><a name="d0e5547"></a>RSV:Gen.1.1@cp[8] Points at the starting
                  	character of the word "beginning."

               <li class="body"><a name="d0e5552"></a>RSV:Gen.3.20@cp[32] Points to the starting character
                  	of the word "Eve."

            </ul>
            <p>
                    
            </p>
            
            <p><a name="d0e5559"></a>This operator will be the most useful for automated systems that
                     allow users to point and select a point in the text for
                     automatic generation of this operator. When this syntax was
                     being developed, the editors made the mistake of picking an
                     example before considering how tedious it was to count spaces,
                     apostrophes, and other punctuation that goes into the total for
                     a cp operator. Users who wish to avoid the tedium of (and error
                     prone as well) counting characters, may wish to use the s
                     operator.
            </p>
            
            <p>The <b>s</b> grain operator is a string, enclosed by square brakets and
                     preceded by the "@" sign, all of which follows, at a mimimum,
                     the main part of an osisRef. For example:
               
            </p>
            <ul>
               <li class="body"><a name="d0e5569"></a>RSV:Gen.1.1@s[beginning] Points at the starting
                  	character of the word "beginning."

               <li class="body"><a name="d0e5574"></a>RSV:Gen.3.20@s[Eve] Points to the starting character
                  	of the word "Eve."
               </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
               You may wish to convince yourself that the <b>s</b> operator is easier to use
                     than <b>cp</b> but to each his own.
            </p>
            
            <p><a name="d0e5587"></a><b>Warning:</b> Note that the <b>s</b>
                     operator does not allow spaces. That is to say that you cannot
                     put a phrase between the square brakets. That limiation is due
                     to the handling of spaces in XML. It was an issue that the
                     editors struggled with for some time but ultimately, it was
                     decided that word level matching would meet most users
                     needs.

            </h3>
            
            <p><a name="d0e5600"></a>It is often the case that texts make references to a range of Bible
                     verses and with the osisRef mechanism, not only duplicates that
                     ability, but also provides for the grain matching mentioned
                     above.
            </p>
            
            <p><a name="d0e5603"></a>The beginning of a range in an osisRef is indicated by a hyphen "-"
                     character that occurs at the very end of the first part of the
                     range. That hyphen is immediately followed by the same order of
                     expression found in the first part, with one exception, there is
                     no prefix allowed on the second half of an osisRef range.
            </p>
            
            <p><a name="d0e5606"></a>The reason to disallow a prefix on the second half of a range is
                     quite simple. A range, at least in the OSIS sense, is defined as
                     occurring within a work. That is to say that a range that
                     attempted to say: Bible:Gen.1.1-Livy:Bk.1, would make no sense
                     to any processor. So, when using the range operator, be sure
                     that the range occurs within a single work.
            </p>
            
            <p><a name="d0e5609"></a>With the omission of the prefix, the second half of a range follows
                     the same rules as the first half.

            The work of BTG has also been greatly enhanced by many other members
            of these and other organizations, who have responded to drafts, made
            numerous, useful, and sometimes essential recommendations, and
            encoded texts to test the schemas for usability, consistency, and
            other virtues. Especially notable among these have been Robin Cover,
            Jonathan Robie, and Bob Pritchett.
